This is a test in polymer and litelemnts.

I managed to display the user inputs in the console as well as alert, though ensuring that the user inputs were unique was a problem i.e is name
is added twice it will be so alerted as two different objects.

Fetching and displaying the results was not an issues. the issues is with the sorted json where it is printed on each card element of the fetcched results.

including bulma css to my project was a nightmare and coldn't manage that.
